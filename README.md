## Run the Progress Bar

### Linux Instructions
- In a separate terminal run the redis server 

```console
$ redis-server
```

- After the redis server is running successfully, navigate to the mqp_project directory in the project in a seperate terminal 
- Once you completed the above step, run the following command 

```console
$ celery -A mqp_project worker --loglevel=info
```

- After running the command, you can now run the project normally


### Windows Instructions
- Install redis. This is easier to do through the Windows subsystem for linux by running ```$ sudo apt-get install redis-server```. Otherwise, there are a large amount of unofficial windows versions of redis that can be found online and should work as well.

- In a separate terminal run the redis server 

```console
$ redis-server
```

- Celery is not officially supported on Windows but can be run via another another library called gevent (source for solution: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37255548/how-to-run-celery-on-windows). Install gevent with the following command:

```console
$ pip install gevent
```

- After the redis server is running successfully, navigate to the mqp_project directory in a terminal separate from the redis server. Run the following command 

```console
$ python -m celery -A mqp_project worker --loglevel=info
```

- This should eventually show ```celery@<your device> ready.``` and then hang. If the redis server is not running, it will have an appropriate error message. After running the command sucessfully, you can now run the project normally in another terminal.
> NOTE: You will have 3 terminals in total. One to run redis, one to run celery, and another to run the django server.
